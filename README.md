# Vite template #2

This is a refactoring of [vite-react-ts-jest-template](https://github.com/deeprave/vite-react-ts-jest-template)
but using vite-native but (somewhat) jest-compatible vitest as the test runner.

## Description

This template provides a working configuration (as at July 2022, unfortunately subject to change!)
that provides:

- A basic React app, using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Using [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- With the capability of testing with [vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
  and [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- Support for scss styles

This process for setting this up is relatively smooth without requiring (much) babel and other tooling.

This project exists as a contrast to setting up for testing with jest in vite/react projects.

## Recommendation

Use vitest!
